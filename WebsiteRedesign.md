I want to redesign this website. Use the website design skill. 

AESTHETIC:
I want to an aesthetic that is slightly off white, and doodles, and also cute looking. 

Take inspiration from Notion, this website https://nabiu.studio/, and the images in the `inspiration` directly. 


Use the image of my sample landing page as a rough guideline. Let me know if you can't understand the website layout. 

I want it to look similar to the naibu studio design. A little doodle sun in the top right. 

My name should be in the center, with a short description. Below that, a 'ground', with some characters that are interactive. (hover, some element). Clicking on each one will pull up a different website. 


One of the sprites (people/objects) will be a link to the blog section of the website, which doesn't exist right now. 

Consult the plan, use the skill. Ask me lots of questions, then let's proceed with the refactor. 


The current landing page on the website should just be moved to a new index, at `/oldlandingpage`. 

Again, ask questions. Then Make a plan
