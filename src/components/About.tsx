const markdwn = `I've lived in NYC for 3 years, and grew up in Bangkok, Thailand. Working remote was fun, but I find myself missing an office, a charged work environment. I'm looking for roles largely in person, or hybrid with talented people that push me to grow.

### Outside of Work

I'm an avid ceramicist (Brooklyn boy! I know.) I've made bowls, mugs, and even a lamp. I recently finished a watercoloring class, and next I want to try woodworking. It's a dream of mine to build a sofa.

### Software Projects

I graduated as a math major with an casual interest in software engineering. After 4 years of working-for-work, I'm trying to pique my interest again.

### September Project

I'm building [_Drawniture_](https://drawniture.vercel.app/), **a website where you can draw your ideal furniture piece and it'll return similarities to you** (WIP). There's a box for specifying style, and some colors. This is also my first serious exploration of Claude Code (damn, it's good).

### October Project

I wonder how people rank "website attractiveness". I bet there's a metric for it. How long people spend looking at a website, like digital advertising. I want to build a tool to feel websites and get an attractive score back out.`;
