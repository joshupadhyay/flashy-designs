# Building Drawniture

Drawniture is my September project - a website where you can draw your ideal furniture piece and it'll return similarities to you.

## The idea

I've always been fascinated by furniture design. Herman Miller, Knoll - these names represent something aspirational to me. But finding furniture that matches what's in your head is hard.

What if you could just... draw it?

## Technical approach

The project uses:
- A canvas for freehand drawing
- Computer vision to extract features
- A similarity search against a furniture database

It's still a work in progress, but the core concept is working.

## What I learned

This was my first serious experimentation with Claude Code. The experience of having an AI pair programmer that can actually write and debug code is transformative.

More updates to come as I refine the search algorithm!
