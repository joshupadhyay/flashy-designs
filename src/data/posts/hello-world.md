# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on software, design, and life in NYC.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:
- **Software engineering** - backend development, cloud architecture, and interesting technical challenges
- **Side projects** - like Drawniture and other experiments
- **Life in NYC** - from a Bangkok native's perspective
- **Creative pursuits** - ceramics, watercoloring, and my dream of building furniture

Stay tuned for more posts!
